# project-4-bayesnets
Bayes Net Inference Project for Spring 2021 CS188

A python3 (+ small modifications) version of https://github.com/BerkeleyAI/bayesNets2

This is my fourth project from this Berkley class. I added in code to fill in some pieces, but the majority comes from the berkley page linked 
above. I did this for my own learning and want to keep a record in my github.
